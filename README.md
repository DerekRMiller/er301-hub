# ER-301 community hub

this site is a proof of concept, or rather a testing environment for our quest to find a way to easily share code, patches, presets and packages for the ER-301 sound computer. The original forum discussion is here [Package management, distribution, organization - V0.6](https://forum.orthogonaldevices.com/t/package-management-distribution-organization-v0-6/5280?u=bparticle)

## Nuxt content

As a first experiment for managing and displaying content from different contributors, let's try out the [Nuxt content submodule](https://content.nuxtjs.org/). This approach will require contributors to pull the code and manually add their content in subfolders.

## Organization

Organizing the different packages, units, presets and matching them with different firmware versions is currently what I'm trying to conceptualize in my head. Stay tuned. üòÅ
